// Create a function called copyCat that takes in an array, copies, and
// returns the second and third index values.

/*

Your copyCat is not doing what was asked for.
They did not ask you to add elements to the array
It said to make a new array with two elements.


copyCat is asking you to construct a simple array with only two elements.
Please study how to make a simple array.
It is the most basic of javascript array syntax.
